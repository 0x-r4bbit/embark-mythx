Status Embark plugin for MythX.

This plugin brings MythX to Status Embark. Simply call `verify` from the Embark console and `embark-mythx` sends your contracts off for analysis. It is inspired by `truffle-security` and uses its source mapping and reporting functions.

# QuickStart

0. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and provide your MythX login information. If omitted, MythX will run in trial mode.

```
MYTHX_ETH_ADDRESS="<mythx-address>"
MYTHX_PASSWORD="<password>"
```

1. Run `verify [options] [contracts]` in the Embark console. When the call returns, it will look something like this:

```
Embark (development) > verify
embark-mythx: Running MythX analysis in background.
embark-mythx: Submitting 'ERC20' for analysis...
embark-mythx: Submitting 'SafeMath' for analysis...
embark-mythx: Submitting 'Ownable' for analysis...

embark-mythx: 
/home/flex/mythx-plugin/testToken/.embark/contracts/ERC20.sol
  1:0  warning  A floating pragma is set  SWC-103

âœ– 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning)

embark-mythx: MythX analysis found vulnerabilities.
```

# Installation

Add `embark-mythx` to the `plugins` section in your `embark.json`. To have the plugin permanently ignore one or multiple contracts, add them to the configuration:

```
"plugins": {
  "embark-mythx": {
    "ignore": ["Ownable", "Migrations"]
  }
}
``` 

# Usage

```
verify [--full] [--debug] [--no-cache-lookup] [--limit] [--initial-delay] [<contracts>]
verify status <uuid>
verify help

Options:
	--full			Perform full rather than quick analysis.
	--debug			Additional debug output.
